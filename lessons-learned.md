# Lessons learned
Is a group of lessons I have learned during my life as an engineer (and not only).

###### Design/build a stack when building a complex application
An idea is consolidating in my mind that when building a complex application (such as pazienti.it) we absolutely need to design create and mantain a specific stack.

I watch this around a lot. I bet this kind of stuff can be learned somewhere anyway I came to this after a couple of years of experience working with a very big application.

###### How are you about to deploy it then?
When you start building something, think about how you will deploy it to the public. Decide the frequency, timing, tools, branches and all that stuff you always say is not important at first.
Things tend to get very complex afterwards, simplify your life and adopt a continuous deployment methodology to your app's deployment and push features like there's no tomorrow!
