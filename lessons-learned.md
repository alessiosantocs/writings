# Lessons learned
Is a group of lessons I have learned during my life as an engineer (and not only).

###### Design/build a stack when building a complex application
An idea is consolidating in my mind that when building a complex application (such as pazienti.it) we absolutely need to design create and mantain a specific stack.

I watch this around a lot. I bet this kind of stuff can be learned somewhere anyway I came to this after a couple of years of experience working with a very big application.
