#All in
These days I have been reading a couple of posts about startups.
I came through this post (post del tipo che ho passato a linnea) and I wanted to do two things, share it with everyone and talk about it.

The first point in this short list is sharing it, so... well I am sharing this post with you and this post contains the link to the article and I also shared it on Twitter. One, done.

The second on my list is talk about it. Being in a startup is so difficult and exciting at the same time. Building something - most of the time cool - that could help people and save the world.

This field is quite a risky one and most startups fail within three years. That's why you need to innovate and 'fail fast' as they say. 
Bullshit. (forse troppo forte)

Don't get me wrong it is okay to fail often and fast, especially when you're running out of cash. I do believe that the lean startup thing is a great tool to help entrepreneurs validate their hypotheses. But it's just that, a tool.
Use it whenever it's possible because it could speed up things but be careful, it could also kill your business.

Indeed, without commitment, you'll never get so far. To me, entrepreneurs and developers have one characteristic in common. They both enjoy starting things. 
Indeed I can understand that sensation to come out with a brand new brilliant idea that will - absolutely - change my startup.

What happens next is that you slowly start losing interest for what you're doing at that moment - maybe you are discouraged because things are not going as you expected - and decide to build the next big thing that will turn your carrer into a glorious one.

The key to success is - to pivot when necessary, yes - to fully and truly commit to what you are doing now.
Like a shoe needs time to perfectly fit to your feet, an idea needs time to grow and become strong.

If you are wondering how this magic can happen and how you can become committed to an idea or a mission... I can't tell you that, it's personal.
I can tell you what I learned instead. 
A recipe to commitment (without instructions).

##Five cups of Belief.
Belief is not passive. It is extremely active indeed. You need to stoke the fire that burns inside. It'll keep you safe when the dark comes (and it comes).
It's trust that you'll figure out things and learn from your mistakes. That it will grow.

##A lot of Passion.
Never getting tired of something. When your job becomes your favorite hobby. When you fully put yourself into things.
That's passion.

It doesn't have to make perfectly sense. It could be helping others, changing the world or building a website. 
When you have passion for something you can do that thing for your entire life smiling all the time.
If you do not have passion - well - you're in trouble.

##Perseverance at will.
Like I should - well would like to - meditate every morning and I don't; you should spend the right amount of time on an idea - before jumping into another - and probably you don't.

Perseverance brings discipline, through discipline you become focused and if you're focused you're aware. And knowing what's happening around you is crucial for you and your business.

As Derek suggests there is no half-ass. You gotta dive in full-ass to get everything. If you don't fully commit you'll make big mistakes and perhaps you'll fail.

##It's not just you.
If you are part of a team these things are a must for you. Try to remember the moment in which you really felt a great part of the project you're in and recall that moment every time you feel too far from the mission.

If your a founder you should know these things already. Form a culture of commitment and sorround yourself of people with sparkles in the eyes.
Quantity doesn't count, quality does. You'll see many, you'll hire a few.

Does your team fully and truly commit to your mission? Do you?
