#Pilot
I like TV shows.

The first episode of a TV show is often called pilot. I like that.

Let me introduce - not myself - my diary. This is my journey in a startup from developer to first time to CTO. 
I'll try hard to write every morning because it keeps my mind clear.

I can't tell what I'll write about in advance, because my path isn't decided yet.

I hope this diary - which is an old kinda thing - will help me and whoever reads it.

Comments are opened. Let's begin.


##The startup I'm in
It's about lives. We care about them. We're in the health field. It is booming right now.

I guess the health system is getting ready to be disrupted? Hope so. 
Everyone is trying to make a difference.

We tried several different things. Some worked, some didn't. Now what?
We're working on a backup plan and a risky one. 
The backup plan is pretty promising. Early adopters for the third time now. But we already have a brand so people already trust us, I guess.

The other one is exciting but it's still in the CEO's mind. Trying to figure out where we're gonna go next. The team is trying to optimize the exsisting platform.

I started as a developer and the only thing I had to worry about was writing code. I am pretty good at it.

Now things are changed. I became the CTO and VP of engineering of the company and things are getting complicated.

It is fun.
