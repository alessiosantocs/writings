These days I'm working on Magnetiq a simple html canvas game similar to Sinuous but better :)

We basically started rewriting it in coffee from the bones of the first only-javascript version. That version was incredibly raw and was a first try of building a custom 2d graphic engine.

Yes because I realized a few days ago that what we're basically doing is building a totally new and customized graphic engine.

It's not formed completely but yet it does have a:

- Custom animation engine
- A collision engine
- A simple but effective system to draw objects automatically into the canvas

I have to say that building this kind of system (as basic as it is) was quite straight-forward. In one long night and some bites of days was done.

The thing that strikes me now is the Levels manager. The need is to easily create levels and make them work seamlessly into the scene of the game. We managed to find a way to do that in a simple way but there's a long road ahead of us and we're just getting started.
